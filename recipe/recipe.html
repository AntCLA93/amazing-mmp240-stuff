    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Prepare Ingredients:</strong>  Cut 1 kg (2.2 lb) of beef into large chunks, slice the 2 to 3 carrots, chop the 2 onions, mince the 3 cloves of garlic, and clean the 250 g (8.8 oz) of mushrooms.</p></li> 
        <li><p><strong>Brown the Beef:</strong> Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add the beef chunks and brown them on all sides. Once browned, remove the beef and set it aside.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Sauté Vegetables:</strong> In the same pot, add the chopped onions and carrots. Cook them until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 more minute.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Add Flour:</strong> Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of flour over the vegetables and stir well to coat everything. This will help thicken the stew.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Add Wine & Broth:</strong> Pour in 500 ml (2 cups) of red wine and 250 ml (1 cup) of beef broth. Stir to combine. Return the browned beef to the pot.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Season & Simmer:</strong> Add 2 sprigs of thyme, 1 bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and let it simmer for 2.5 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally, until the beef is tender.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Sauté Mushrooms:</strong> About 30 minutes before the beef is done, heat 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan and sauté the mushrooms until golden brown. Add them to the stew.</p></li> 
        <li><p><strong>Serve:</strong> Once the beef is tender and the flavors have melded, remove the thyme and bay leaf. Serve your Boeuf Bourguignon hot, accompanied by potatoes, pasta, or crusty bread.</p></li>
